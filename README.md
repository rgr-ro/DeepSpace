# DeepSpace
**A TensorFlow PixToPix based Neural Net which transforms diffused images into fake space photos.**

The input image is received by the neural network. Then the neural network generates the predicted image. The Ground Truth image represents the ideal target output. 

These images passed as input were not in the training dataset. View the code in [DeepSpace.ipynb](https://github.com/rgr-ro/DeepSpace/blob/master/DeepSpace.ipynb).

These are the results with a training dataset of 51 random images of the original 64 images dataset and an iteration of 500 epochs.
